				columnar legs, and huge head with temporal glands and wide, flat ears. Since they have few enemies to fear, 
				elephants are usually peaceful and easygoing. They show great affection for one another, and females spend 
				their lives as members of a family herd.</p>

					which thrives in African savannas. </p>
