## Description 
The assignment was to make a trading card set to certain specifications. I decided to do more and added two extra animals and some optional CSS styling. The colors represent my heritage, Jamaican and Ethiopian. The animals I chose are unique like me and I'm really glad with the finished project. It's easy on the eyes and very informative! I bet you'll learn something new.
